# carmix-creator

This is a fairly simple app I wrote years ago (say 2006-ish) to help me collect songs that I wanted to burn to disc for use with my revolutionary car stereo that could play MP3s!

Now I will be using it to help write blog entries as I update it from Java 5 era code to using newer constructs found in the newer versions of Java, starting from 7 and working my way to 9. Some of those entries include updating to try-with-resources and buidling a more complete UI. I might even move it over to Java FX at some point.

This application is intended as a teaching and learning tool for myself and anyone that wishes to follow along at [http://joelforjava.co].
